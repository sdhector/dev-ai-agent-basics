# Archive: Original Files

## üìÅ What's in this folder?

This folder contains the original files from before the repository was reorganized into a structured course format.

## üîÑ Repository Reorganization

On [Date], this repository was transformed from a collection of individual scripts into a structured **OpenAI Function Calling Mastery Course** with 6 progressive lessons.

### Original Structure (Archived Here)
- Individual Python scripts demonstrating different aspects of function calling
- Supporting files like `requirements.txt` and `USAGE_GUIDE.md`
- All files were in the root directory

### New Structure (Current)
- **6 Lesson Folders**: Each with its own README guide and supporting scripts
- **Progressive Learning**: From basic concepts to enterprise architecture
- **Organized Content**: Files are grouped by learning objectives

## üìã Files in this Archive

### Core Examples
- `function_calling_example.py` - Complete production-ready example
- `simple_function_call_demo.py` - Bare-bones example showing raw JSON responses

### Execution Mechanism Explanations
- `function_execution_explained.py` - Step-by-step breakdown of confusing code
- `functions_as_objects_demo.py` - Demonstrates functions as first-class objects

### Minimal Implementations
- `minimal_core.py` - Absolute minimal version (27 lines)
- `simple_function_caller.py` - Interactive interface with demos
- `test_simple_caller.py` - Automated tests

### Modular Architecture
- `function_registry.py` - Dedicated function library
- `function_executor.py` - Generic execution engine
- `modular_function_calling_demo.py` - Modular system demonstration

### Production System
- `demo_function_system.py` - Comprehensive demonstration with 6 demos

### Supporting Files
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `USAGE_GUIDE.md` - Original usage documentation

## üéØ Where to Find These Now

All these files have been **copied** (not moved) to their appropriate lesson folders:

- **Lesson 2**: `function_calling_example.py`, `simple_function_call_demo.py`, `requirements.txt`
- **Lesson 3**: `function_execution_explained.py`, `functions_as_objects_demo.py`
- **Lesson 4**: `minimal_core.py`, `simple_function_caller.py`, `test_simple_caller.py`
- **Lesson 5**: `demo_function_system.py`, `USAGE_GUIDE.md`
- **Lesson 6**: `function_registry.py`, `function_executor.py`, `modular_function_calling_demo.py`

## üöÄ Start Learning

To begin the course, go to: **[Lesson 1: Understanding the Problem](../lesson-01-understanding-the-problem/)**

## üóëÔ∏è Can I Delete This Archive?

Yes! This archive exists only for reference. All the important content has been reorganized into the lesson structure. You can safely delete this folder if you want a cleaner repository.
