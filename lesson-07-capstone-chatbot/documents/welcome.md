# Welcome to Your Markdown Chatbot! 🤖

## What is this?

This is your personal document management assistant! I can help you:

- 📁 **List files and folders** in your documents
- 📖 **Read existing files** to show you their content
- ✏️ **Create new files** with any content you want
- 📝 **Update existing files** by replacing, appending, or prepending content
- 🗑️ **Delete files** when you no longer need them
- 📂 **Create folders** to organize your documents
- 🏷️ **Rename files and folders** to keep things organized
- 📦 **Move files** between different folders

## Security Features

For your safety, I can **only** work with files in this `documents/` folder. I cannot:
- Access files outside this folder
- Read system files
- Modify anything on your computer outside this sandbox

## Getting Started

Try asking me to:
- "List all my files"
- "Create a new file called notes.md"
- "Read the welcome.md file" (that's this file!)
- "Create a folder called 'projects'"

## Example Commands

Here are some things you can say:

```
"Show me what files I have"
"Create a file called todo.md with my task list"
"Add some notes to my existing file"
"Move my notes to the projects folder"
"Rename my file to something better"
"Delete that old file I don't need"
```

## Ready to Start?

Just ask me to do something with your files, and I'll help you manage your markdown documents!
